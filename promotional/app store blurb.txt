The Big 3 is a task list app that helps you focus on what’s most important.

Most task manager apps let you list every possible thing that you could want to do. Then, when it’s time to get things done, your list is so long that you can spend more time managing it than checking things off.

The Big 3 takes a different approach.  It lets you focus on the 3 things that you need to do right now.

You plan out your Big 3 goals all at once.

Then you have to either complete each goal, or say that you’re not going to do it today.

You can’t start a new Big 3 until you’ve completed or postponed everything in your current Big 3.

The Big 3 includes a watch app so that you can track and complete your Big 3 on your watch.

It also includes a range of widgets for both the home screen and lock screen.

And it lets you import and track reminders from your Reminders app.
