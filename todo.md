#  todo

## to make UI more acceptable to App Store:
- [ ] add done button to History
- [ ] check boxes are shown by default
- [ ] no ghost check in checkboxes
- [ ] no BrandedHeader for button in Review View

- [ ] consider a mac port as a menu bar addition
- [ ] test against mac (probably not)
- [x] done row on watch should have a rounded rectangle background instead of the full rectangle
- [x] test against iPad
- [x] try a circular widget
- [x] when a goal is completed in the watch app, it's added to the history on the phone app
- [x] watch app updates info on host app
- [x] watch app reports info from host app
- [x] widget
- [x] logging to a history
- [x] big 3 background
- [x] importing from reminders

## had problems:
- [ ] try watch widgets (may be synch issues...)
